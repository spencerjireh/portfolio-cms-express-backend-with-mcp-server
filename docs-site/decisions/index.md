# Architecture Decision Records

This section documents the key architectural decisions made for the Portfolio Backend project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help:

- Document the reasoning behind decisions
- Provide context for future developers
- Enable informed reconsideration of decisions

## Summary

| ADR | Title | Status | Summary |
|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| [001](/decisions/001-database-choice) | Database Choice | Accepted | Turso (libSQL) for edge-friendly SQLite |
| [002](/decisions/002-caching-strategy) | Caching Strategy | Accepted | Layered Redis/Memory with Token Bucket rate limiting |
| [003](/decisions/003-llm-abstraction) | LLM Abstraction | Accepted | Provider abstraction layer for flexibility |
| [004](/decisions/004-repository-pattern) | Repository Pattern | Accepted | Abstract data access for testability |
| [005](/decisions/005-observability) | Observability | Accepted | Events and OpenTelemetry tracing |
| [006](/decisions/006-pii-obfuscation) | PII Obfuscation | Accepted | Token-based obfuscation for LLM calls |
| [007](/decisions/007-content-model-flexibility) | Content Model | Accepted | Flexible JSON with app-level validation |

## ADR Template

When adding new ADRs, use this template:

```markdown
# ADR NNN: Title
