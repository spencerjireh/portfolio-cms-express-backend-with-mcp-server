# Introduction

The Portfolio Backend is a TypeScript/Express API designed to power personal portfolio websites. It provides:

- **Content Management System (CMS)** for portfolio content with versioning
- **AI-powered chat** for visitor engagement with privacy protection
- **MCP server** for AI tooling integration (Claude Desktop, etc.)

## Why This Project?

This project demonstrates proficiency in modern backend patterns while being production-ready:

| Goal | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Showcase Backend Skills | Clean architecture, proper patterns |
| Production-Ready | Observability, security, resilience |
| Maintainable | TypeScript, clear separation of concerns |
| Extensible | Easy to add features without refactoring |

## Key Features
